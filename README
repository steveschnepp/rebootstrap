This project aims to do QA re-bootstraps of Debian architectures. It is
considered experimental, so if it breaks, you keep the pieces. Never use
something other than throw-away chroots. You have been warned.

The bootstrap.sh script tries to re-bootstrap a given (host) architecture from
a build chroot with nothing but sid sources. No binaries from the host
architecture are reused. It expects to be able to install packages and will
leave the filesystem in a dirty state (creating symlinks without tracking
them). It has only ever been tested with pbuilder:

pbuilder --execute bootstrap.sh HOST_ARCH=$host_arch

The following variables are supposed to be given as parameters (but setting
others is not prohibited):

 * HOST_ARCH: The architecture that shall be bootstrapped.
 * MIRROR: The Debian mirror to use.
 * DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS: Use with care. It may not work without nocheck and
   setting parallel=n with n > 1 breaks some architectures.
 * REPODIR: A directory where built packages should be placed.
 * ENABLE_DIFFOSCOPE=yes: Compare cross built packages against natively
   built packages from the archive.
 * GCC_VER: The gcc version (currently 6 or 7) to be used for building
   the toolchain. If GCC_VER is not set, bootstrap.sh uses the default
   gcc version in unstable. If the given gcc version is not available in
   unstable, bootstrap.sh tries to fetch it from the experimental suite.


Technical information about the bootstrap process
=================================================

Notice: this text uses GNU-style cross-build terminology, i.e.

- build-arch: the architecture on which bootstrap.sh runs

- host-arch: the architecture to be bootstrapped


Package repositories
--------------------

Bootstrap.sh uses reprepro to setup two local package repositories
in ${REPODIR}:

- "rebootstrap" for the host-arch packages

- "rebootstrap-native" for the build-arch cross-toolchain
  packages that are built from source as a prerequisite of
  the bootstrapping process

These local repositories are given higher preference than the official
Debian repositories by applying appropriate Pin-Priorities, so that the
bootstrap process uses the locally-built packages instead of binary
packages from the Debian archive in case a package exists in both the
local and the official Debian repository.

Every time a package has been built, it is added to the corresponding
repository and a "stamp" file "${REPODIR}/stamps/${PACKAGE_NAME}" is
created.  For packages that require being built in several stages
during the bootstrap phase (such as gcc, a C library and the kernel),
the number of the stage is appended to the stamp name, e.g.
${REPODIR}/stamps/{gcc_1,gcc_2,gcc_3,glibc_1,glibc_2,linux_1}.


Patches
-------

For a number of packages, patches are necessary to make crossbuilding
possible.  These patches are carried inside bootstrap.sh in form of a
function named "patch_${PACKAGE_NAME}()", which usually includes the
actual patch as a here-document and applies it to the already unpacked
sources.  For getting a patch included in bootstrap.sh, an attempt at
upstreaming must be made. That can be one of Debian bug report, an
upstream bug report or an upstream commit. The patch function must
record a reference to the effort (e.g. a bug number). An example:

  patch_foo() {
    echo "fixing foo FTCBFS #123456"
    drop_privs patch -p1 <<'EOF'
  [actual patch in here]
  EOF
  }

Alternatively, the patch_${PACKAGE_NAME}() function can perform
modifications to the unpacked sources using any other method available
in a shell script, e.g. by using "sed" to alter files.  An example:

  patch_elfutils() {
    echo "work around FTBFS with gcc-7 #853387"
    sed -i -e 's/-Werror//' config/eu.am
  }


Preseeding the build environment for specific packages
------------------------------------------------------

Configure scripts sometimes depend on running code on the host-arch to
determine specific properties, but this is not possible while
crossbuilding a package.  In those cases it is therefore necessary to
supply the result of the corresponding autoconf test in advance.  This
can be done by providing a function named buildenv_${PACKAGE_NAME}()
which preseeds the build environment like in the following example:

  buildenv_foo() {
    export ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes
  }

Using the autoconf cache the cross-config binary package split out of
dpkg-cross is avoided due to the high number of wrong results, useless
variables and missing variables.

Changing build-dependencies
---------------------------

In some cases it can be necessary to manipulate the list of
build-dependencies during bootstrap. By default, bootstrap.sh
uses "apt-get build-dep" for satisfying build-dependencies,
but if a function named builddep_${PACKAGE_NAME}() is defined,
it gets called instead with the host-arch as $1 and the set of
build-profiles as $2.

Note that "automatic" packages (see below) cannot have a build
dependency hook unless the satisfiability of can be determined
using the original Build-Depends (e.g. adding dh-autoreconf is ok).
Updating Build-Depends via a patch hook should be preferred (with
the same limitatios regarding "automatic" packages).


Package build mechanism
-----------------------

The first step of the bootstrap process is creating a cross-toolchain
(binutils, gcc and glibc or musl) which runs on the build-architecture
but produces code for the host-architecture.  Once this toolchain is
available, it is used to build all packages that are part of the
"essential" (Debian policy section 3.8) and the "build-essential"
(Debian policy section 4.2) sets.

Building a package inside bootstrap.sh can happen by different means:

- By explicitly performing all necessary steps "manually".

- By using the cross_build() function, which allows to easily
  cross-build a single package.  This works only if all build-
  dependencies of the package in question are already available
  in the local "rebootstrap" package repository.  cross_build() gets
  passed the package to build as $1 and optionally a set of
  build-profiles as $2.

- By using the automatically_cross_build_packages() function, which
  works on a list of packages and recursively tries to resolve their
  build-dependencies, so that it can build the packages and their
  dependencies in the right order.

automatically_cross_build_packages() is the workhorse of the
bootstrapping process, but it cannot cover all cases.  In particular,
it cannot automatically handle packages that require staged builds with
different build-profiles.

Every time automatically_cross_build_packages() is executed, it
iterates over the current contents of ${need_packages} and recursively
determines the build-dependencies of all packages in the list.  Each of
the build-dependencies that hasn't yet been built gets added to
${need_packages} for further processing.  Once all build-dependencies
for a package in ${need_packages} are available, this package gets
built automatically (by executing cross_build()).  Afterwards, the
package is added to the local package repository and the package name
is removed from ${need_packages} and added to ${built_packages}.

At the beginning of the bootstrap process, ${need_packages} gets
initialized with a list of the "essential" packages. Further packages
can be added by using the add_need() function.

Both the initialization of ${need_packages} from the "essential" set
as well as the automatic addition of build-dependencies to
${need_packages} in automatically_cross_build_packages() is limited
to packages that are also listed in ${automatic_packages}, i.e.
${automatic_packages} acts as an upper bounds to the list of packages
that are automatically added to ${need_packages}. To add a package to
${automatic_packages}, use the add_automatic() function.
